## User Story
````
AS a user I want to be able to have an application where I can rent beach, hiking, and snow equiptment for whatever kind of activity I am planning to partake in.

I WANT to able to signup and login onto the website and see all the rental gear and equiptment that I need for my activity.

I WANT to be able to choose a location and see the rental equiptment for that specific location instead of all rentals.

I WANT to be able to add items to my cart, view my cart, and view previous orders as well.

So THAT I am able to checkout and put in my card payment for my items that I am renting.
